When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

- A remote repository can act as a backup for your work
- You can share files over a remote repository very easily
- If you work from multiple computers at different times you can easily log in to a remote repository to grab the latest version of any files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- You can decide whether the changes in the remote repository should affect your local project
- For example, there might be other people contributing to the remote repository but you don't need their updates in the work that you're doing
- Or you may not want git to automatically sync your updates locally with those on GitHub
- Pulling manually gives more control over what information you're storing locally
